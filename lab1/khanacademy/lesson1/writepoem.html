    <h1>Love and Friendship </h1>
    <p>Love is like the wild rose-briar,<br>

Friendship like the holly-tree— <br>

The holly is dark when the rose-briar blooms <br>

But which will bloom most constantly? <br>


The wild rose-briar is sweet in spring, <br>

Its summer blossoms scent the air; <br>
Yet wait till winter comes again <br>

And who will call the wild-briar fair? <br>


Then scorn the silly rose-wreath now <br>

And deck thee with the holly’s sheen, <br>

That when December blights thy brow <br>

He still may leave thy garland green.</p>
